     <h1Poem's</h1>
    <p>Poem’s are powerful
That aint a debate
If you disagree with me
You should be afraid
Cause I’ll come for you 
I won’t hesitate
I’ll trespass on your 
Real estate

Once I arrive 
I’ll sprint to you
And tell you what you got to do
‘Write a poem like this 
It’ll change your life 
I promise my guy
give it a try’

After I give you that lecture
I’ll drive home
And sit down in my throne
Cause you probably don’t know
I’m the king of poem’s 
And if you hate on them again 
I’ll break your bones
